Documentation
-------------

Documentation is provided as a set of manpages in the src/ subdirectory.
Please read the Xbae-FAQ (in doc/FAQ.html) before contacting the maintainers 
or mailing list unless you are willing to receive some nasty (or no) replies!

You may convert the man pages and print them out with a suitable
roff-like program. Using GNUroff (groff) a sample commandline
would be
   groff -t -Tps -man XbaeMatrix.3 >XbaeMatrix.ps

The online XbaeMatrix(3) man page suffers from a very large table,
spread over a few pages which causes problems with most versions of
nroff, groff, etc.  If this is the case for you, you will need to use
the PostScript version for the resource table.  If you can help out in
formatting the table so it works in the online manual page, please
contact us.


What the widgets do:
--------------------

XbaeMatrix:

XbaeMatrix is a Motif widget which presents an editable array of
string data to the user in a scrollable table similar to a
spreadsheet. The rows and columns of the Matrix may optionally be
labeled. Also, a number of "fixed" and "trailing fixed" rows or
columns may be specified - these behave similarly to the labels. While
XbaeMatrix looks and acts like a grid oF XmText widgets, it
actually contains only one XmText.  This means that XbaeMatrix
widgets with hundreds or thousands of rows have much less overhead
than they would if they used an XmText for each cell. XbaeMatrix
has callbacks for doing field validation and customizing traversal. It
allows cells to be assigned independent colors.  It allows rows,
columns and regions of cells to be selected or highlighted.  The
matrix can be dynamically grown or shrunk by adding and deleting rows
and columns at any position.  The widget has many resources to allow
individual customisation and can be made to look and behave like an
extended list widget with added functionality.  Pixmaps (both colour
xpm and standard bitmaps) can be displayed in individual cells with
the callbacks available in the widget.
   

XbaeCaption:

XbaeCaption is a simple Motif manager widget used to associate an
XmLabel (caption) with it's single child. The label may be either an
XmString or Pixmap and can be displayed in any one of twelve positions
around the perimeter of the child. XbaeCaption's geometry management
technique is to simply "shrink wrap" it's child and display the
caption alongside it.  By using XbaeCaption with an XmFrame child,
groups of related widgets can be labeled similarly to the IBM CUA
"Group Box", but with more flexibility.  XbaeCaption is also useful
for associating labels with individual XmText widgets.


XbaeInput

XbaeInput is a subclassed from the XmText widget and allows keystrokes
to be validated as well as the final string.  It is very handy for
restricting user input.
