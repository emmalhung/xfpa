! Note on colours:
!
! There are some differences in the colour tables on various UNIX and Linux
! platforms. To ensure that a similar set of default colours is displayed, an
! RGB colour format is used in some locations. Affected colours and their RGB
! equivalents (hexadecimal) under HPUX include:
!
!   MediumForestGreen  RGB:32/81/48
!   SlateBlue          RGB:7E/88/AB

! The program to use to display the online help can be set by the resource
! xfpa.onlineHelp.program. If not set the program fpahelp will be used, but
! this requires gtk-1.2 or below. Any Mozilla project type of browser such as
! firefox can be used.
!
! If the browsers settings do not open the help information in a new tab and
! this action is desired, set xfpa.onlineHelp.newTab to True.

!
!  Set how colour is handled. We have five options, each, except for the
!  default and visualID, with two possible parameters. Only one of the 5
!  options may be used at any one time.
!
!  NOTE: Given that almost all new computers run in 24 bit truecolor this
!        section is now really not needed but is kept just in case. FPA
!        should be run in 24 or 32 bit truecolor so the default determination
!        will work most of the time.
!
!  If none of these is specified, or if the specified option is not available
!  then the program will find the "best" visual that it can to run in. This is
!  normally the one with the greatest depth.
!
!  For those of you with multiple displays (multi-head setups) the
!  applicationDepth, visualClass and visualID resources can have multiple
!  entries, one for each screen. The entries are in the form
!
!    <screen number>:<value>
!
!  Thus we could have for visualID
!
!    .visualID:  0:0x21  1:0x25
!
!  When run on screen 0, FPA would use the visual with an ID of 0x21 and
!  when run on screen 1 would use the visual with an ID of 0x25.
!
!  The options are:
!
!  1. Don't set any of these resource options and FPA will use the "best"
!     depth, visual and colormap. This is the recommended option.
!
!  2. Set FPA to run in a non-default visual and depth. For this we use
!
!       .visualClass:      - one of PseudoColor or TrueColor. I strongly
!                            suggest using PseudoColor only at 8 bit depths.
!       .applicationDepth: - this depends on the computer that the application
!                            is running. On HP workstations it is usually one
!                            of 8, 12 or 24. On PC's running Linux it is usually
!                            8, 16 or 24. Given present day graphic power there
!                            is no good reason to not run at 24 bit depth.
!
!     The visualClass only needs to be set if there is more than one of these
!     for the specified depth.
!
!  3. Set a specific visual id. For this we use
!
!       .visualID: - the visual id number (ie. 0x20).
!
!       Information as to the number and identifiers of the visuals available
!       on any given machine can be obtained by running the program xdpyinfo.
!
!  4. Instruct FPA to use a private colormap. Only valid for pseudocolor
!     visuals (normally 8 bits).
!
!       .usePrivateColormap: - either True or False
!       .ncopyColors:        - this will copy the given number of colours
!                              from the default colormap to minimize flashing.
!
!     Note that there are some older computers with a main screen at 24 bit
!     truecolor and the second screen 8 bit pseudocolor. In this case the
!     automatic selection may give the application a private colormap on the
!     second screen. If this happens seting .ncopyColors to some non-zero
!     value like 50 will copy the colours on the second screen to reduce
!     colour flashing.

! The following entry defines the order the screens will appear in in the

! and so on. In order to keep things simple the monitors are assumed

! thus define the screens (or X server) assigned to each monitor in the order
! from left to right. There can be any number of entries, so that three+

! If the system used multiple X servers instead of screens we could have

! GENERAL NOTE ON FONTS
!
!  Unlike the font specifications for motif which use a render table, fonts here
!  are used by the graphics library

! The default font if any specified font cannot be found

xfpa.defaultFont: XFT:DejaVu sans

!  Default fonts used in the map area (where all of the graphics are displayed).
!  The program has a hard codes set of defaults but these can be overriden here.
!  The syntax is key=description, key=description, ... The key names of the fonts
!  that can be redefined are:
!
!     fixed, fixed_bold,
!     sans_serif, sans_serif_bold, sans_serif_italic, sans_serif_bold_italic,
!     serif, serif_bold, serif_italic and serif_bold_italic.

xfpa.defaultMapFonts: fixed = XFT:DejaVu sans mono,\

!  Fonts selectable by the user for on map text that are provided in the
!  scratchpad and sampling panels.
!
!  The first line is a list of "tags", defined above, which are used internally
!  to list and recognize the fonts. 
!
!  The second line specifies a list of font descriptions that correspond to the

!
!  The third line gives the list of font sizes which are available and the
!  fourth line gives the labels to use for the font sizes for display to the
!  user. The font sizes are a percentage of the visible map size and the

!  that there are as many size labels as there are sizes.
