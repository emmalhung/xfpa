##############################################################################
#
#  This setup file provides customised information to all FPA applications.
#  Some of the information pertains to every application, while other
#  information is relevant to specific applications.  To facilitate this,
#  the information in this file is organized into logical blocks.  Each block
#  is represented in the following simple structure:
#
#      block_id
#      {
#          keyword value1 value2 ...
#          keyword value1 value2 ...
#      }
#
#  Note: (1) Lines starting with a "#" or "*" are comments.
#        (2) To maintain embedded spaces put the string in quotes.
#        (3) Brackets delimiting a block must be on their own line.
#        (4) In some instances '$' may be used in a value to refer to shell
#            variables, but correct expansion of complex patterns is not
#            guaranteed.

#  Target Map Setup:
#
#  This block defines the target map projection and related parameters used by
#  all FPA applications.
#
#  All data brought into the application will be transformed to the map
#  projection given here.
#
#  The information here takes precedence over the map projections given in
#  the map background and overlays, the depictions and the ingested guidance.
#
#  If you wish to have an ingest using a different target map projection or
#  resolution you must use a separate setup file for your ingest process.
#
#  The target map projection is defined by 3 lines, beginning with
#  "projection", "mapdef" and "resolution".  The "projection" and "mapdef"
#  lines use the same format as the current metafile standard (version 1.5 and
#  later).  The "resolution" line specifies the desired spline resolution and
#  units for continuous spline fields.
#
#  Latitudes and longitudes may be specified in decimal degrees, or degrees,
#  minutes and seconds.  The hemisphere may be indicated by a letter (N,S,E,W)
#  or by a sign (+=N,E -=S,W).  Examples:
#
#     52W
#     45.75N    (decimal)
#     67:45W    (degrees-minutes)
#     47:33:20N (degrees-minutes-seconds)

#  Directories Setup:
#
#  This block defines the directories used by all FPA applications.
#
#  The first word is a key used by the system software to identify the
#  directory and the second is the path of the directory.
#
#  Use of "home" directory:
#
#    If a "home" directory is defined in this block all relative paths will be
#    interpretted as being relative to its path.  The library software which
#    reads this file does a chdir() to the "home" directory automatically.
#
#    If "home" is omitted from this block, no chdir() will be done.  Instead,
#    all relative paths will be interpretted as relative to the directory
#    defined by the $FPA environment variable (or $HOME if $FPA is not
#    defined), and will be converted to absolute paths by concatenating this
#    directory.
#
#  Default directories:
#
#    Most of the directories that can be specified here have been given
#    internal default values.  For most directories, the default is
#    appropriate and a value does not need to be specified in this file.
#
#    Many directory keys can actually refer to a list of directories.  If so,
#    this defines a prioritized sequence of places to look, when searching for
#    an existing file.  The first matching file found is used.
#
#    If a directory key is defined in this block, then the specified directory
#    is searched ahead of the default directories.  This provides a mechanism
#    to supply local files that override certain default files.
#
#    To view the internally defined list of default directories, use the
#    fpadir utility.

#    Note: If this data block is not given the language list will
#          default to English and French.
#
#  [product.text]
#      label fcst_key
#
#    Lists the regular issue forecast products which will be made available
#    to the forecaster for generation and issue.  There may be more than
#    one selection.
#

#      fcst_key = an internal key corresponding to the entry for this forecast
#                 in the "Forecasts" configuration file.
#
#    Note: If label is given as <-> then a space will be inserted into the
#          list of forecasts in the user interface.  Using this one can
#          block the list for easier reading.
#
#  [product.timezones]

#
#  [product.graphic]
#      label type parms
#
#    This is similar to product.text except for graphical products. If just
#    label is specified then the entry is taken to be a label to appear in
#    the list with no action associated with it. This can be used to visually
#    group list items for easier reading.
#
#      label = label to appear in the product selection list.
#      type  = the type of graphic processing. This can be one of:
#               "psmet"         = produce graphics using PSMet.
#               "svgmet"        = produce graphics using SVGMet.
#               "texmet"        = produce graphics using TexMet.

#                                 to another location.
#      parms = parameters specific to type
#
#    For type "psmet", "svgmet" and "texmet" parms are:
#
#           dir pdf
#
#        dir = directory (relative to "psmet" or "svgmet" or "texmet" setup
#              directory) where the product definition file exists.
#        pdf = product definition file.
#
#    For type "metafiles" the parms are:
#
#           pdf
#
#        pdf = product definition file.  If an absolute path is not specified,
#              then this is taken relative to the "metafiles" setup directory.
#
#  [product.point]
#      "type_label" type_id [pdf_1 ... pdf_n]
#      "type_label" type_id [pdf_1 ... pdf_n]
#
#    Provides information required by the point forecast menus in the interface.
#    The label is whatever the user sees and the type_id is type of forecast
#    (recognized by the forecast generator) to be generated by this group.
#
#    Each line can have an optional list of product definition files, which
#    defines the set of pre-defined point forecasts for that line.  Any
#    forecasts taken from this list cannot be modified or deleted from the
#    point forecast interface by the user.
#
#  [title]
#      label
#
#    Optional. Specifies a title for the program window.  The default is the
#    name of the database.
#
#  [T0.roundOff]
#      delta
#
#     Set the time roundoff for the setting of T0. This will roundoff T0 to the
#     nearest time boundary defined by this setting. For example, 6 will result
#     in a T0 to the nearest 6 hour interval. If the current time was 16:36 GMT
#     then T0 would be 12 GMT.
#
#     delta = Time delta in hours

#
#  Ingest Setup:
#
#  This block controls the ingest of numerical weather model output (GRIB
#  format and others).
#
#  The ingest operation is overseen by the Ingest Daemon (fpaingest).  This
#  program monitors the raw data files identified in this block, and detects
#  if they have been created or updated.  If this happens, the Ingest Daemon
#  will launch the appropriate Ingester (e.g. gribin for GRIB data).  The
#  Ingester extracts and processes the desired data and creates new FPA
#  metafiles in the appropriate guidance directory of your database.
#
#  A line beginning with "wait" defines the time (in seconds) that the Ingest
#  Deamon will go to sleep before checking for new data again.  If this line
#  is omitted, a default (300) will be used.
#
#  A line beginning with "log" identifies the log file to be used. The log
#  file will be placed in the "ingest.log" directory, as defined in the
#  "directories" block, unless an absolute path is given.  If this line is
#  omitted, a default (ingest.log) will be used.  This line also specifies a
#  backup log file and the time of day (GMT) at which to move the current log
#  to the backup.  If omitted, defaults (ingest.old at 0000 GMT) will be used.
#
#  A line beginning with "status" identifies the status file to be used. The
#  status file will be placed in the "ingest.stat" directory, as defined in
#  the "directories" block, unless an absolute path is given.  If this line is
#  omitted, a default (ingest.stat) will be used.
#
#  Each line beginning with "monitor" or "monitor_in" identifies a set of data
#  files to be monitored by the Ingest Daemon.  These lines have the following
#  format:
#           monitor <type> <pattern>
#           monitor_in <dir> <type> <pattern>
#
#  where <type> defines the type of data so that the Ingest Daemon can launch
#               the correct Ingester to process files.  The following <type>s
#               are currently supported:
#                 grib  = process GRIB Version 0 or 1 files with "gribin"
#                 grib2 = process GRIB Version 0, 1 or 2 files with "gribin2"
#
#        <pattern> specifies a filename, or a sed(1) style regular expression
#                  that may match one or more filenames.  If one or more
#                  matching files arrives, its new modification time is
#                  detected, and the appropriate Ingester is started up to
#                  process it.
#
#        <dir> specifies a directory tag (must be defined in the Directories
#              Block), which tells the Ingest Daemon where to search to find
#              files that match the given pattern.  By default (as for
#              "monitor") the Ingest Daemon searches in the "ingest.src"
#              directory.
#
#  Note: "monitor" may become obsolete in future releases.

#  Diagnostic Control Setup:
#
#  This block controls the diagnostic output from modules in the FPA software.
#
#  Behaviour of diagnostic output may also be determined or altered by external
#  influences, such as run-string arguments.  For example, the -debug argument
#  in xfpa causes the information in this block to be used, otherwise a default
#  level and message style (3 and 0) is used and this block is ignored.
#
#  A line beginning with "default" defines the default output level and message
#  style for all modules.
#
#  A line beginning with "module" defines the output level for the given module.
#
#  Output levels are defined by a number from 0 to 5:
#
#         0 = no output
#         1 = errors only
#         2 = include warnings
#         3 = include status messages
#         4 = include information messages
#         5 = include diagnostic messages
#
#  Message styles are defined by:
#
#         0 = module name does not appear with message
#         1 = module name followed by ":"
#         2 = module name in "[]"
#
#  Module names already exist within the FPA library code.  Additional module
#  names may be added at any time.
