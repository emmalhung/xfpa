Example Tabular Products from TexMet

This directory contains some examples of tabular products which can
be generated from the TexMet version of the Graphics Product Generator.
The controlling "pdf" files are given in upper-case letters.  A short
description of each product is given below.

These examples are meant to be run from the FPA demo database, but
they can be modified to run from a local database if desired.  The
user should make a copy of the required "pdf" files in the local
"texmet" directory, and modify lines followed by the comment ...

  ! EDIT

The graphics products are ...

HOURLYWINDS

  Tabular list of hourly temperatures (in degrees C) and winds
  (direction in 10s of degrees and speed in knots) for selected
  locations.

HOURLYWX

  Tabular list of hourly weather for a selected location.  (This
  might be used as guidance for an aviation site forecast.)

PGRID and PGRID_TABLE

  Mean sea level pressure (in mb) sampled over an evenly spaced grid
  of locations.  PGRID_TABLE uses an older table format to do this.

PLIST

  Mean sea level pressure (in mb) and winds (direction in 10s of
  degrees and speed in knots) sampled from a list of locations.
  Note that latitude/longitude locations, map coordinates and
  location lookup table sites are all allowed.

COMMENTS_AVIATION_2

  Text files used as templates for inclusion in the "Comments" section
  of the PSMet or CorMet graphics product AVIATION_2.


These examples may be used as templates for local tabular products.
Good Luck.
