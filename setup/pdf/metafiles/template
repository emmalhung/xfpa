#  Product Definition File (PDF) for copying and processing
#  FPA graphic metafiles.
#
#  This process can be used to copy graphic metafiles to a
#  given directory and then apply some processing to those
#  files. Usually this will be to send the files to another
#  machine at the production site or to another site via
#  ftp or some other mechanism.
#
#  The keys in this PDF are:
#
#  SOURCE = Where the metafiles are to be taken from. Usually
#           this is either "depict" or "interp" for depictions
#           and interpolations. More then one source may be
#           specified.
#
#  TIME = Time offset, in hours, from T0 to use for the graphic.
#         Either ALL for all times or a list of time offsets.
#         The offsets can have one of two formats. The first is
#         þdt where dt is the offset in hours. The second if
#         þd/hr where d is the offset in days from the day of T0
#         and hr is the absolute houre (GMT) on that dey. If T0
#         was 1996/10/8 06Z, a time offset of 1/12 would result
#         in a time of 1996/10/9 12Z where as a time offset of
#         12 would result in a time of 1996/10/8 18Z.
#
#  FIELDS = Either ALL for all fields or a list of fields. Thus
#           one could have pressure msl temperature sfc wind sfc,
#           and so on.
#
#  SEND_LINK_FILE = Send the time link information along with the
#                   metafiles. Usually this would only be required
#                   if the source was interp and ALL was specified
#                   for TIME and FIELDS.
#
#  TARGET_DIRECTORY = The directory into which the metafiles are copied
#                     by FPA. If the directory does not exist it is
#                     created. Note that the directory is not emptied or removed. 
#
#                     If not specified then a temporary directory is created, and
#                     once the post process finishes the directory and its contents
#                     are removed. The temporary directory is referenced in the
#                     post process line by including the macro $METADIR.
#
# POST_PROCESS = Optional parameter. This sets shell command(s) which
#                are executed after the metafiles have been copied. This
#                could be used for additional processing, for example
#                sending the metafiles to some other node via ftp or
#                some such process. Note that a variety of commands 
#                could be executed if separated by a semi-colon.
#
# 
# Example 1
# 
# SOURCE           = interp
# TIME             = ALL
# FIELDS           = ALL
# SEND_LINK_FILE   = True
# TARGET_DIRECTORY = 
# POST_PROCESS     = tar -cf /tmp/meta.tar $METADIR; compress /tmp/meta.tar;
# 
# Example 2
# 
# SOURCE           = depict
# TIME             = 0 6 12 24
# FIELDS           = pressure msl temperature sfc
# SEND_LINK_FILE   = False
# TARGET_DIRECTORY = users/fpa/analysis/depictions
# POST_PROCESS     = analysis_program
