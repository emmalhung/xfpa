#     Wind Entry Menu Definition File
#
# This file defines the format for the information required by the
# wind entry menus (including the background wind entry menu).
# It is rather simple for now, but is expected to increase in
# complexity with time as system capabilities grow.
#
# The format of the entries is:
#
#    [header1 key]
#        data line 1
#        data line 2
#        ...
#    [header1 key]
#        data line 1
#        ...
#
# At the moment there is just one header key defined and this is
# "models" followed by the recognized model names as specified in
# the config files.
#
# Example:
#
#    [models]
#        Vg_Msl
#        Vr_Msl
#        Vc_Msl
#        Vx_Msl
#

[models]
    Vg_Msl
    Vr_Msl
    Vc_Msl
    Vx_Msl
