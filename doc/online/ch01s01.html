There is an ongoing discussion regarding automation of weather forecasting, and whether automation can replace human forecasters. It is true that the tools available to a meteorologist certainly influence what happens during a forecasting shift. It is equally true that some automated processes are relatively inaccessible to human intervention.
However, the <span class="acronym">FPA</span> was designed to enhance the role of the human forecaster, not decrease it. It is very difficult to program sufficient contextual information into a computer, and so far humans routinely outperform pure automation if the weather information needs of end users are relatively specialized.
Humans can adapt in the face of uncertainty and synthesize highly variable compact messages depending on what is happening and what end users need to know.
There are many economic cases where human decisions are valued, and it is in those scenarios that the <span class="acronym">FPA</span> will be of most interest.
</p><p>
The <span class="acronym">FPA</span> is a "representation" tool, and so it is similar to but different from visualization and drawing tools.
It has a graphical interface and users can interact with meteorological "objects".
The "objects" exist as discrete or continuous fields within the system and can be "queried" as to their state, essentially making it possible to think of any collection of "objects" as a "database".
Once forecasters are satisfied with their "database" (or "depiction" set) automated processes can be invoked to generate products.
</p><p>
It is important to note that the <span class="acronym">FPA</span> is not a monolithic program that all forecast processes must feed through.
There are certainly visualization and analysis tasks that can and possibly need to be performed by other software.
The question is, "What happens <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> visualization and analysis?"
Hopefully the results of visualization and analysis lead to an improved mental model of current weather conditions as they relate to the needs of end users.
Before <span class="acronym">FPA</span>, this mental or conceptual model was inaccessible to computerized processes.
Now with <span class="acronym">FPA</span>, forecasters can construct their own (or shared) representation of what needs to be communicated to end users as products.
</p><p>
The object representation technique in <span class="acronym">FPA</span> is not somehow anti-numeric-model, nor does it necessarily imply model "modification".
The choice of models available is a weather office policy decision.
The <span class="acronym">FPA</span> philosophy simply reflects the reality that not all models come up with the same result, and forecasters may have extra information inaccessible to numeric models.
The optimal mix of human-machine interaction is still a subject of debate, and the debate will continue to evolve as technology progresses.
Meanwhile, there are real end users of forecast information that need reasonably-priced, high quality, expert advice <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>.
<span class="acronym">FPA</span> is best used when communication goals are kept in mind.
</p><p>
Design choices in the <span class="acronym">FPA</span> are frequently the result of feedback from operational forecasters, and so further and ongoing feedback is encouraged.
It is hoped that over time, <span class="acronym">FPA</span> technology will simply be seen as a way to get things done.
