<para>
Look up tables allow conversion of &FPA; style attribute values or sampled
values into text for display. They are accessed
by the <userinput>look_up</userinput>, <userinput>case_look_up</userinput>, or <userinput>attribute_look_up</userinput> <userinput>keywords</userinput> in the 
<link linkend='tx_label'>@label</link> and <link linkend='tx_sample_field'>@sample_field</link>
directives. Files containing look up tables have a ".tab" suffix.
</para><para>
Look up tables contain lines with the following format:
<programlisting>
    <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> : <replaceable>symbol</replaceable> : <replaceable>text</replaceable> : <replaceable>presentation</replaceable>
    <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> : <replaceable>symbol</replaceable> : <replaceable>text</replaceable> : <replaceable>presentation</replaceable>
    <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>
where:
<informaltable frame='none' rowsep='0' colsep='0'><tgroup cols='2'>&colwidth;<tbody>
<row valign='top'><entry><replaceable>key(s)</replaceable></entry><entry>are one or more "value" strings separated by "white space" (such as blanks or tabs)</entry></row>
<row valign='top'><entry><replaceable>symbol</replaceable></entry><entry>is a graphic symbol file (not used by &TexMet;)</entry></row>
<row valign='top'><entry><replaceable>text </replaceable></entry><entry>is text to display (quotes not required)</entry></row>
<row valign='top'><entry><replaceable>presentation</replaceable></entry><entry>is a named presentation (not used by &TexMet;)</entry></row>
</tbody></tgroup></informaltable>
</para><para>
Note that one of symbol, text, or presentation must be non-blank, but that the others can be left blank if not required.
Note also that lines without the <userinput>:</userinput> separators are considered comments, as are all parameters that follow the <userinput>!</userinput> or <userinput>#</userinput> characters in a line.
</para><para>
When an &FPA; field is sampled by one of the directives, each of the <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable>
is tested against the resultant &FPA; "value" string. Each time one <replaceable>key</replaceable> is found
within the &FPA; "value" string, one "hit" is registered, and the "best" match
in the look up table is defined as the first line in the file where the maximum
number of "hits" has been found. The text from that
line would then used by the directive for displaying the sampled value.
Two "special" <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> are allowed.
<simplelist>
<member>The <replaceable>key</replaceable> <userinput>*missing*</userinput> will match against blank &FPA; "value" strings.</member>
<member>The <replaceable>key</replaceable> <userinput>*default*</userinput> will match against &FPA; "value" strings that register no "hits" in the look up table.</member>
</simplelist>
</para><para>
The type of display to use depends on each directive.
</para><para>
The <link linkend='tx_label'>@label</link> <link linkend='tx_sample_field'>@sample_field</link>
directives display the values sampled at each location with a text string
given by text (if the keyword <userinput>format</userinput> is set to text).
</para><para>
The order of the lines in the look up table is extremely important. Lines
with the most complicated "value" strings should always be included before
lines with simpler "value" strings, and all lines with a single <replaceable>key</replaceable> should be
included before lines with two <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable>, and lines with two <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> before lines
with three <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable>, and so on.
</para><para>
When several lines register the same number of "hits", the line that appears
first in the look up table will be used. For example, the <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> for rain "R"
and light rainshowers "RW-" will both register one "hit" against the &FPA;
"value" string for reduced visibility in light rainshowers "1-3RW-", since
each <replaceable>key</replaceable> is found within the &FPA; "value" string. However, if the line for rain
appears in the look up table before the line for light rainshowers, then the
line for rain will ALWAYS be chosen first, and any special presentation for
light rainshowers will never be accessed. Therefore, complicated "value"
strings should always be listed before simple "value" strings.
</para><para>
The number of <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> in a line does not affect the choice of a "best" match.
One "hit" on a line with one <replaceable>key</replaceable> is equivalent to one "hit" on a line with
several <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable>. For example, a line containing the <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> for rain and snow
"R S" and a line containing the <replaceable>key</replaceable> for rain alone "R" will both register one
"hit" against the &FPA; "value" string for light rain "R-". However, if the line
containing the <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> for rain and snow appears in the look up table before
the line containing the <replaceable>key</replaceable> for rain alone, then the line containing the <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable>
for rain and snow will ALWAYS be chosen first, and the corresponding presentation for mixed rain and snow will be used. Therefore, lines containing fewer <replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> should always be listed first.
</para><para>
Care must also be taken to ensure that the combination of look up table
<replaceable>key(s)</replaceable> and &FPA; "value" strings does not register incorrect "hits". For
example, a line containing the <replaceable>key</replaceable> for snow "S" will register a "hit" against
the &FPA; "value" string for risk of a thunderstorm "RISK TRW". In this case,
the "hit" occurs because of the "S" in "RISK"! It may be necessary to
constrain the use of some "value" strings within the &FPA; to avoid generating
unwanted matches in the &TexMet; application.

The following example of a look up table and examples of matches with
&FPA; "value" strings is based on look up tables that are no longer used, but
the basic principles are still applicable.

<example><title>Look up file format</title><para>
<programlisting linenumbering='numbered'>
TRW          : thunder : Thunderstorm   : trw1
RW           : rain    : Showers        : shower1
R            : rain    : Rain           : rain1
S            : snow    : Snow           : snow1
