This manual is intended to help programmers integrate Ingred into application programs and thus gain access to its meteorological field editing power. It is not intended to 
act as a programmer's manual as no details are given as to the internal workings of the program itself.

Ingred is a series of library functions and has no user interface within itself. In order 
to maintain flexibility Ingred is configured through the use of configuration and set up files. 
Configuration files contain information on all possible states and set up files contain information on the configuration specific to the particular application and is a subset of the configuration files.
