The output of the &FPA; is a set of graphic, text, and/or data products.
These products may be suitable "as is" for dissemination to various clients.
In other cases &FPA; products must be sent further down the "production line" for modification or packaging.
Generally &FPA; end products are placed somewhere in a user's &FPA; data directory, but the exact location can usually be specified in the "directories block" of a setup file.
&FPA; provides hooks that allow the initiation of external processes once a product is placed in a release directory.

allied models, archiving, printing and other process which are run externally to &FPA; are all handled within the &FPA; Product Manager script (<application>fpapm</application>).
</para> <para>
This script may be modified by the client site to implement procedures specific to the site.
You must be aware, however, that a new release of &FPA; will probably contain a modified version of fpapm and that any changes made by the client will have to be made to the revised script.
It is suggested that a note be made of all changes made to the script so that they can be inserted into any new release.
