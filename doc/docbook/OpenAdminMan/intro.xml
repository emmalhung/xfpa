<preface id="intro"> <title>Introduction</title> <para>
The Forecast Production Assistant (&FPA;) is a unique computer program developed by the Meteorological Service of Canada for use in operational weather forecasting.
</para> <para>
The &FPA; allows forecasters to represent and interact with conceptual models of the atmosphere.
Meteorologists use the &FPA; to create a series of weather charts, known as depictions, that show weather fields over a sequence of times.
The weather fields can contain grid point data or sets of areas, lines or scattered points.
The weather depictions are not just graphical displays, but windows into an object database.
By connecting processes to the database, forecast offices can automatically generate forecast products or run local models, while spending more of their time on weather analysis, diagnosis and prognosis.
