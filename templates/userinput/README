EXAMPLE_PLOT

  The routine "example_plot" is designed to be modified and
  loaded with a command line of:

    inputmake  example_plot

  The routine "example_plot" has been set up to run with a command
  line of:

    ex_plot  <local_setup>  1999:156:12  plotdata_1999:156:12

  where <local_setup> is the local setup file name.

  The output file "epsfc_1999:156:12" will be produced in the
  "Guidance/EXAMPLES" directory of the data directory of
  the local setup file.



EXAMPLE_GRID

  The routine "example_grid" is designed to be modified and
  loaded with a command line of:

    inputmake  example_grid

  The routine "example_grid" has been set up to run with a command
  line of:

    ex_grid  <local_setup>  1999:156:12  griddata_1999:156:15

  where <local_setup> is the local setup file name.

  The output file "pnmsl_1999:156:15" will be produced in the
  "Guidance/EXAMPLES" directory of the data directory of the
  the local setup file.
