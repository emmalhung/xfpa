User-Defined Template Source-Code Files for ASCII File Output from the FPA

This directory contains template files (ANSI-C source, scripts and makefiles)
for building local client-written processes to access the FPA database as
"Allied Models".

    W A R N I N G ! ! !

    Do not modify the original files found in $FPA/templates.  These files
    will be updated with future releases and patches.  It is intended that
    you copy them to a convenient directory, and build the library there.
    The script "copyfiles" has been provided for this purpose.

This directory should contain the following files:

    README ................ this file
    copyfiles ............. script which copies the template files to a
                             working directory
    example_extract.c ..... source template for accessing the FPA database
    binmake ............... script which builds the processes
    binput ................ script which places the processes where they
                             can be accessed by the operational FPA software
    binrestore ............ script which restores the previous version of the
                             processes used by the operational FPA software
    Makefile.bin .......... "make" file used by binmake

Once you have copied the template files to a convenient working directory,
instructions for writing your own functions are given in the README file
and inside the individual ".c" files.

To test the processes before installing them with the operational version,
build the processes using binmake, add the information to the local setup
file and local Config file (as described below), then set and export the
FPA_EXEC_PATH variable to the directory in which the processes were just built.
You may run these processes either directly or through the "Allied Models"
pulldown in the development FPA interface.

Once tested, you may then install the processes in an operational directory,
using the binput script.  Unset the FPA_EXEC_PATH variable.  The binrestore
script provides the ability to go back to the last working version of the
processes, if they turn out to have been installed prematurely!


EXAMPLE_EXTRACT

  The following changes or additions are required to run
  "example_extract" ...

   - addition of "EX_EXTRACT" to the "[allied.model]" section
      of the "interface" block of the local setup file

   - addition of the following section to the "Sources" block
      of the local configuration file

  The routine "example_extract" is designed to be modified and
  loaded with a command line of:

    binmake  example_extract

  The routine "example_extract" has been set up to run either
  as an "Allied Model" from within the FPA, or directly with a
  command line of:

    ex_extract  <local_setup>  EX_EXTRACT  ""  <run_time>  <valid>

  where <local_setup> is the local setup file name,
  <run_time> is a timestamp in YYYY:JJJ:HH or YYYY:MM:DD:HH
  format (where YYYY is the 4 digit year, JJJ is the 3 digit
  day of year, MM is the two digit month, DD is the two digit
  day of month, and HH is the two digit hour of day), and
  <valid> is one or more  valid times of the data in XX or
  RR/HH or YYYY:JJJ:HH or YYYY:MM:DD:HH format (where XX is
  the number of hours from the "run_time", and RR is the
  number of days from the "run_time").

  The output files

   "sfctemp_<valid_time>"  and  "wind_<valid_time>"

  will be produced in the "AModels.DATA/EXAMPLES" directory
  of the data directory of the local setup file (where
  <valid_time> will be a timestamp in YYYY:JJJ:HH format).
