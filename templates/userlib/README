User-Defined Library Template Source-Code Files

This directory contains template files (ANSI-C source, scripts and makefiles)
for building your own local client-written library, that can be accessed by FPA
applications.

	W A R N I N G ! ! !

	Do not modify the original files found in $FPA/templates.  These files
	will be updated with future releases and patches.  It is intended that
	you copy them to a convenient directory, and build the library there.
	The script "copyuserlib" has been provided for this purpose.

This directory should contain the following files:

	README ........... this file
	copyuserlib ...... script which copies the template files to a working
					   directory
	user_rules.c ..... source template for rules to calculate attribute values
	user_values.c .... source template for value calculations
	user_winds.c ..... source template for wind calculations
	libmake .......... script which builds the library
	libput ........... script which places the library where it can be accessed
					   by the operational FPA software
	librestore ....... script which restores the previous version of the library
					   for use by the operational FPA software
	Makefile.lib ..... "make" file used by libmake

Once you have copied the template files to a convenient working directory,
instructions for writing your own functions are given inside the individual
".c" files.

To test the library before installing it as the operational version, build the
library using libmake, then set and export the FPA_SHLIB_PATH variable to the
directory in which the library was built.  Running any FPA application from that
environment will access the newly built library.

Once tested, you may then install the library in the standard directory, using
the libput script.  Unset the FPA_SHLIB_PATH variable.  The librestore script
provides the ability to go back to the last working version of the library, if
it turns out to have been installed prematurely!
